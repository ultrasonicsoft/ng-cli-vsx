# Inline Angular/CLI Commands

Tired of switching to integrated terminal or separate command prompt for running Angular CLI commands while building Angular application?

Then try out this extension.

It runs Angular/cli commands from Visual Studio code editor. Now you can run `ng cli` commands from any file (.html, .ts, .css, *.*) without leaving current cursor in your VS code editor.

## Usage

1. Type any valid angular command anywhere in active editor
2. Select command
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to list all installed extensions
4. Type `ngcli` and select in list

## Output

1. Selected command shall be run in integrated terminal
2. Selected command will be deleted from editor
3. Editor shall receive focus back from integrated terminal

## Requirement

Latest version of Angular/CLI
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

**Enjoy!**
